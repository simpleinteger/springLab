Hi <%= "#{@user.first_name.capitalize} #{@user.last_name.capitalize}"%>,

Thank you for your interest in SpringLAB @ Irvine. We have our meetings every week on Mondays from 1-3PM. All that we ask is for you to come with an idea for your company, review the onboarding package, complete the MOKR, and email a copy to patrickwu912@gmail.com. We will walk through the MOKRs with you and help you complete your first management report at your first meeting. We will also email you the location of our meeting (not because itâ€™s a secret, but because we are still figuring out a consistent room situation).

Hope to see you soon at our meetings!

 

Best,

SpringLAB
