Hi <%= "#{@user.first_name.capitalize} #{@user.last_name.capitalize}"%>,

Thank you for your interest in SpringLAB @ Irvine. We have our meetings every week on Mondays from 1-3PM @ Calit2 (room 2421 MDP Lab). All that we ask is for you to come with an idea for your company, review the onboarding package, complete the MOKR, and email a copy to patrickwu912@gmail.com. We will walk through the MOKRs with you and help you complete your first management report at your first meeting.

Hope to see you soon at our meetings!

 

Best,

SpringLAB
